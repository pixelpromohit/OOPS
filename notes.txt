*** Advantages of classes over structures?
-> data hiding is not possible in structures
-> functions cant be added in structure

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

NESTING OF MEMBER FUNCTIONS :

OOPS -> classes and objects

class -> extension of structures (in C)
structures had limitations
    -> no data hiding
    -> no functions inside structures
classes -> structures + more
classes -> can have methods and properties
classes -> can make few members as private & few as public
structures in C++ are typedefed
you can declare objects along with class declaration
    /*class Employee {
        // Class definition
    } John, Daisy, Julia;*/
John.salary = 8 makes no sense if salary is private

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
STATIC MEMBERS AND METHODS

-> static members must declared inside the class and must be defined outside the class
Syntax : int Employee :: count;
-> default value of static members is 0
-> static members in a class are shared across all instances of the class rather than being tied to a specific instance
-> a single copy exists for all objects
-> scope = inside the class 
-> visibility = jab tak program terminate nahi ho jata


Static methods : can access only static variables
-> can be called without creating objects
